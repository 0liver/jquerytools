# flashembed and expose is now under toolbox
# tabs.history and scrollable.mousewheel are now under toolbox as a standalone utilities
# overlay.gallery is removed in favor to tabs.slideshow. 
	

all tools	
	# tabs(number) support is removed
	# api: property is deprecated. use data("tabs") instead --> was a bit forced to do this
	# tabs() is deprecated. use data("tabs") instead  
	# tabs(index) is removed. use els.eq(2).tabs() instead
	# jQuery bind, unbind and one methods can be used (with namespacing + multiple instances at once) 
	# new versioning scheme
	# new global configuration structure
		
		
tabs
	# history as configuration option
	# deprecated "horizontal" effect. separate accordion plugin will be released later
	# if a pane is already visible it is not "clicked" in vain. prevents redundant fadeIn effects when effect is set to "fade"
	
	slideshow
		# play/pause/stop/event bindings to slideshow plugin itself
		# this object and code restructure
	
expose
	# simple, straighforward, lightweight
	# easy access: $.mask.load(), $.mask.close();
	# latest configuration is remembered without argument to load()
	# 2.6 kB
	# conf.startOpacity
	# conf.top
	# conf.left
	# existing element can be used as a mask
	# configuration can be given upon load();	
	# fit called when mask loaded
	# all events are unbind upon close
	
	
overlay
	# removed deprecated getContent method
	# removed the gallery plugin
	# removed onStart event. use onBeforeLoad instead
	# effect's load function receives position as the first argument
	# removed samp>absolute</samp> configuration option
	# fixed configuration variable (is now default). not supported by IE6.
	# <samp>load</samp> configuration option to load the overlay immediately after the initialization
	
tooltip
	# for title tags the tooltip is created automatically with class name "tooltip"
	# tip- option is only used when a single tooltip is used
	# tip and onBeforeShow cannot be given directly on the configuration
	# removed: oneInstance, lazy
	# layout, tipClass
	# isShown(fully)

scrollable
