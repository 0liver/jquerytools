	- new onStart event
	
1.1.1
	- event normalization

	- ability to close the overlay immediately after being opened. onLoad event is not fired unless the overlay is truly opened.  
	
	- isOpened() returns true upon onLoad event
	- fixed a bug where file input field was disabled when overlay is being loaded programmatically. thanks <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/8/27115">ncooley</a>
	
	
1.1.0
	- A whole new <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/overlay.html#effects">effect framework</a> with two effects "default" and "apple"

	- fixed a bug when multiple triggers target the same overlay: thanks @adamlogic in Twitter
	- overlays can now trigger additional overlays (with different effects, expose settings). here is a demo about <a href="/tools/demos/test/overlay-from-overlay.htm">overlay opening another overlay</a>.
	- <samp>finish</samp> configuration object has now been moved to configuration's root level. this may break old installations.
	- <samp>getOverlay()</samp> method. The previous <samp>getContent()</samp> method is now deprecated and will be removed in Tools 1.2.0.
 	- when <samp>closeOnClick</samp> and <samp>closeOnEsc</samp> properties are used together with the <samp>expose</samp> effect then those properties are populated to the expose tool as well
	- If you supply a value to the <samp>close</samp> property, the overlay does not auto-generate a close button
	- <samp>top</samp> configuration variable now accepts percentage values so that it works better in different kind of screen resolitions. By default this is 10%
	
	
1.0.4

	- when overlay is opened the default finish top position is now 100px from the top edge instead of being vertically centered. this improves the readability.
	

1.0.1
	- does not alert when background image is missing
	- did not work when multiple triggers for same overlay

1.0.0 quite a large rewrite
	- multiple simultaneous overlays on a same page, new configuration flag 
	- ability to trigger overlay programmatically

	- ability to define end position for the overlay, relative to scroll position
	- exeptions are caught on user defined callback functions
	- overlay's background images are preloaded into browsers cache by default. can be disabled from configuration
	- new JavaScript API for overlay object
	- each callback now receives this API as their this- variable (as proper programs should)
	
	
0.14
	- made overlay work in Opera
	
0.13 
	- new event model: onBeforeLoad, onLoad, onClose
	- falsy return value in onBeforeLoad and onClose prevents default behaviour
	- new this- variable and arguments for each callback. 
	- errors encountered in callbacks are not messing things up

---------	
Scrollable 1.1.1
	- event normalization	
	- fixed a bug where reload() call broke an existing keyboard navigation feature 
	- added: getClickIndex() method to the API
	- fixed a bug where <samp>onBeforeSeek</samp> and <samp>onSeek</samp> callbacks were called althought the seeking position did not change. this won't happen anymore.
	- brought back the <samp>loop</samp> parameter
	
Circular 1.0.1
	- fixed a bug where <samp>onBeforeSeek</samp> and <samp>onSeek</samp> callbacks were called althought the seeking position did not change. this won't happen anymore.
	
	
	
1.1.0.
	- possible to seek with zero (0) speed	
	
	- possibility to scroll with one sized scrollable by clicking. the direction changes whe beginning or end is reached or navigational buttons are used in which case the scrolling goes to the same direction as the latest seek.
		
	- new method <samp>getNaviButtons</samp>	
	- new event: <samp>onReload</samp> 
	
	- navigational elements must not be siblings anymore. this is only required if you want multiple navigational elements to control the same scrollable or you want to instantiate multiple scrollables with a same call.	
	
	- keyboard arrow keys now advance the same amount as the page size. can be changed with a new configuration option: <samp>keyboardSteps</samp>
	
	- keyboard functionality can now be dynamically disabled/enabled by setting <samp>getConf().keyboard</samp> flag and calling <samp>reload()</samp> after that. See this <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/3/23142#post-23163">forum thread</a> for details.
	
	- fixed a bug where you could not seek to an item who's index is higher than the index of the first item of the last page. this caused a quite lengthy discussion found <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/22384">here</a>
	
	- new "item" configuration property that lets you filter only some of the child elements as scrollable items 
	- if <samp>clickable</samp> property is enabled then <samp>A</samp>- tags inside scrollable won't scroll forward	

	- items configuration variable is not required anymore. If you have only one child element for the scrollable root it is assumed to be the wrapper for the scrollable items. 

	- a new <samp>keyboard: 'static'</samp> configuration option makes the scrollable instance always controllable by the keyboard arrow keys. The scrollable does not have to be actively used.
	
	- new <samp>focus()</samp> - After this call the keyboard arrow keys will control this particular scrollable instance.
	
	- onSeek is triggered *after* the scrolling animation

	- initial plugin release
	
1.1.3
	- IE failed when the tip is an image and the trigger uses a title attribute. 
	
1.1.2
	- tooltip close events (no more hardcoded hover())
	- tooltip works flawlessly with animated effects when being quickly moved from trigger to another. this was especially present in the form demo: http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tooltip/form.html
	
	- fixed IE black box {opacity: 1} bug in toggle effect 
	- event object contains data from the original event	
	- fixed a bug this.getTrigger() returned the tooltip element inside callbacks when the tooltip was being hidden by moving the mouse out of the tooltip (not trigger)

	  http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/30/26527
	  
	- tooltip position is not determined relative to the parent element. document offset() is used instead
	  http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/30/26424.
	  Thanks bericum: http://flowplayer.org/forum/users/15251
	- when calling the <samp>hide</samp> API method the <samp>delay</samp> configuration variable is ignored and the tip will be hidden immediately.

1.1.0
	- If opacity is set to 1 it is not set at all. This caused "black box" problems in IE
	- new <samp>lazy</samp> configuration variable which will make the pages load faster when there are many tooltips. This is enabled by default when there is more than 20 tooltips on the page. For the record 21 triggers this will cause 2336 calls and takes 169.144ms with fast computers.	
	- trigger's <samp>title</samp> attribute can be used as tooltip. This requires that the <samp>tip</samp> configuration variable is given. 
	- <samp>onBeforeShow</samp> is now fed with position argument this usable for plugin developers	
	- if <samp>delay</samp> is set to 0 it is now truly 0 (as opposed to 1 millisecond setTimeout call);
	- new configuration option: <samp>predelay</samp> for enabling delays <em>before</em> the tooltip is shown
	- new effects are no longer added with <samp>$.tools.addTipEffect()</samp> but with <samp>$.tools.tooltip.addEffect()</samp> instead
	- a much simpler syntax for the <samp>position</samp> parameter. It can now be given as string such as <samp>"top center"</samp> old syntax <samp>['top', 'center']</samp> is still supported 
	- <samp>onHide</samp> and <samp>onShow</samp> events are now called as the very last event after the possible animation 
	- default effect "slideup" is now replaced with a highly configurable "slide" effect
	- new configuration properties for the "slide" effect: <samp>direction</samp> specifies the sliding direction and <samp>bounce</samp> specifies whether the sliding comes back to the opposite direction from the original direction.
	- new <samp>cancelDefault</samp> configuration property for removing the browser's default tooltip. The original <samp>title</samp> attribute can still be retriewed with <samp>trigger.data("title")</samp> 
	- when tooltip is used together with form fields the tooltip will not be hidden when mouse leaves it.
	
	- a totally new <a href="tooltip.html#events">event management</a> where you can fully control <em>when</em> the tooltip will be shown or hidden. Thanks to forum posts: <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/24023">this</a> and <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/20/23020">this</a> for the idea.
